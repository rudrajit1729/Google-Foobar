# My Journey

Was randomly surfing for some programming documentation when this portal opened up saying

"You Speak Our Language. Up for A Challenge?" 

On Starting got a UNIX based terminal to solve problems of 5 different levels.

As I progressed through each level questions started getting more challenging.

Level 1 took about 5 minutes whereas level 5 took me about 4-5 hours.

Came across many algorithms and certian concepts like (Marchov's Chain, Burnside lemma and Polya Enumeration to name a few)

Started off as a CS competition but while progressing Math concept and skills were put on a real test.

On clearing Level 3 Google asked for details for consideration with Google Recruiters

Also Got 2 Referral Codes along the way through the levels

Finally cleared all the Levels with sternous debugging and learning a lot of concepts.Probably the toughest coding challenge I have encountered so far in my programming journey.
